## Description

With Academical Reborn people from the Los Andes University can get to know which events the university offers and plan them into their schedule.
The person must register in the system. Later, the person can create schedules and for each schedules he/she can add events.
The events are composed by a name, description and a date. The events are shown in the callendar by hovering and added by clicking on them. If the event crosses with one another, the hovered event shows a red background.
The person can switch between weeks to be able to see which events he has included. He can also switch between schedules to be able to see the events in each of them.

## Objective

We want to allow people to be able to know which cultural events the university offers, and plan them within their schedule.
